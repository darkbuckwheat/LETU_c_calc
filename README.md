# LETU_c_calc
Simple text-input calculator on C

This is a simple education task on my 1 semester of programming in LETU. It is a calculator, that get a string expression as input and output the value.
Programme can sum, subtract, multiply, divide, exponent and evaluate brackets.
Funny moment is that I didn't make unary minus, so users have to use "(0 - 15)" to input -15 :3
It is made on C without catching errors of built-in functions.
For inside logic I used polish notation and hand-made stack.
The logic of two main functions is awful, but I got tired in the middle of a project. So there are a lot of ad-hoc decisions.
But it is functioning. So I call it a day.
